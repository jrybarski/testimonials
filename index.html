                  and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                  thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of
                  my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                  working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.   ”</h4></p>

                <p><h4>“
                  Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
                  some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step
                  by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
                  only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                  staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
                  long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                  outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                  tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                  interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped
                  me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                  100% recommend! ”</h4></p>
